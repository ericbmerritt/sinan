Sinan Documention
=================
Eric Merritt <ericbmerritt@gmail.com>

The Concept
-----------

My goal for the documentation is simply to make it is easy as possible
to write documentation about the various parts if sinan. There are a
few principles we want to keep in mind as we think about that.

- The documnent should be readable text
- Each document should be focused and self contained
- It should be trivial to create documents
- It should bi trivial to link documents


The first point, more or less requieres that we choose a text based
markup, something easy, straitforward and well supported. That is
pretty easy for me, I have experiance with asciidoc and think it works
rather well. This works rather well, I can do nice readable documents
in text and generate good deliverables where I need to.

That addresses the markup, but it doesn't really address the other
points. I want it to be as little impedience as possible between
thinking about writing something and actually writing
something. Between noticing that something is missing, creating a link
to that thing in the document I am currently writing. One of the best
ways to do that that I have ever encountered is a simple wiki with
camel case linking.


There are plenty of wikis out there many of them very good. However, I
want the documentation to live close to the code. I want the versions
to be controled by git and I want to do my editing in emacs. We will
are in emacs and there is just about nothing you can't do there so
... I found a wiki minor mode by Alex Schroeder that can sit on top of
a major mode to provide camel case linking and some other publishing
mode. It need a few changes to work with asciidoc, but those changes
wheren't to hard. So we have a documentation method that works well,
that allows documentation to flow out of your head easily, works in
emacs, and lives close to the code.


The Garden Path
---------------

The easiest way to add and edit documentation to sinan is to use
emacs, have asciidoc mode and the wiki-minor mode and you need the asciidoc tool chain installed.

- http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[The Asciidoc Toolchain]
- http://xpt.sourceforge.net/tools/doc-mode/[Asciidoc Emacs Mode]
- https://github.com/ericbmerritt/wiki-mode[Modified Wiki-mode]

Install these in your emacs folling the usual ways. Then you need to
add a mode hook to load the wiki mode when doc mode load. You can do
that by.

[source,lisp]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
; Turn on wiki mode for all doc modes too
(add-hook 'doc-mode-hook (lambda ()
			   (wiki-mode)))
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This works assuming that you already have asciidoc and wiki-mode
installed.

I will document publishing soon.
